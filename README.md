# EmbedLLM (Android Only)
This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Download the development expo build from this link [Expo Dev Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/eldoon101/projects/embedLLM/builds/6a67b9b8-e12f-4b44-85fd-76400638060d).
This will download an APK file.
If you do not have an android device, make sure to have Android Studio downloaded to get access to android emulators. Afterwards, navigate
to android dir.
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
   This will automatically open any android emulator that you have installed. (Ignore any errors that come out)

4. From project dir,
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   You should see QR code and under that a metro waiting on X. If you are using android emulator copy the link, otherwise scan the QR using the development build. 

6. Press the "Test Embedding" button and have fun!

- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
